**Podio.com** is a cloud-based project management and collaboration platform that allows teams to organize, manage, and communicate on projects, tasks, and activities. It was founded in 2009 and acquired by Citrix Systems in 2012.

With Podio, users can create workspaces, which are essentially customizable dashboards that allow team members to collaborate, share files, and communicate in real-time. Workspaces can be customized with various apps and tools, such as task management, calendars, discussions, and document management.

Podio also has a powerful workflow automation engine that allows users to automate repetitive tasks and processes. This feature can be used to create custom workflows and automate everything from task assignments to follow-up reminders.
